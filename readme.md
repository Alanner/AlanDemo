# Do

Do is a website to help students to publish the message, notification and the task.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each member of the team can see the message and other's status. Most important, the publisher can see everyone's status to know whether he or she has read the message.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And for some student such as monitor , he can publish a task that require student to submit a file like subject's task or homework.And by using Do, there is no need for him to get the file from each student , what he need to do is just publish the task and dowmload the file together.
